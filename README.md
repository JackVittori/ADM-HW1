I'm a physics graduated student, so i only had some coding experience in c++. I started programming in Python some days before the start of the lessons on september, so i had some difficult doing all the exercise of the homework. For this reason i also had to do so many researches on internet  to study Python sintax, methods, data type... Sometimes i also ask to my collegues to help me understanding. Despite the difficulties, after that homework i feel that i understand so many thing about coding in Python and i feel much more confident writing code.
